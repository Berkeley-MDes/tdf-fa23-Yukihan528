# Report 8 - Week of 10/12 - 10/19

This week, my teammates and I continued to [worked on Project 2: Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%208%20-%20Week%20of%2010%2012%20-%2010%2019.md#working-on-project-2). We successfully resolved the Photon communication issues and presented a compelling demonstration of our project. Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%208%20-%20Week%20of%2010%2012%20-%2010%2019.md#reflections-and-speculations) here.

# Report 6 - Week of 09/28 - 10/05

This week, my teammates and I engaged in a productive meeting on "Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education." We conducted a [brainstorming session](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%206%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2028%20-%2010%2005.md#brainstorm-for-project-2), generating various intriguing directions and ideas for our project. In addition, I spent time [exploring Photon 2](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%206%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2028%20-%2010%2005.md#work-with-photon-2), seeking to understand how to integrate it into our second project. Further [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%206%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2028%20-%2010%2005.md#reflections-and-speculations) on these experiences can be found here.

# Report 5 - Week of 09/21 - 09/28

During this week, I've been [learning and experimenting with Photon 2](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#learning-and-experimenting-with-photon-2), guided by Sudhu's helpful tutorial. We also brainstormed for our next project, coming up with many exciting ideas. Additionally, we had a special guest, [Adrian Freed](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#adrian-freeds-lecture), who shared his experiences and knowledge, especially about something called the E-textile Swatch Exchange. Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#reflections-and-speculations) here.

# Report 4 - Week of 09/14 - 09/21
This week, I gathered [feedback from my peers and documented Project 1: Computational Design](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%204%20-Week%20of%2009%2014%20-%2009%2021.md#feedback-from-peers-and-documentation). Then, we kickstarted Project 2 - The Digital Ecosystem! In the initial stages, I followed Sudhu's Photon2 tutorial to [set up my device](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%204%20-Week%20of%2009%2014%20-%2009%2021.md#set-up-photon-2).

# Report 3 - Week of 09/07 - 09/14

This week, I mainly focused on Project 1: Computational Design. I redesigned the cell phone stand based on my preferences; [product features](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%203%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2007%20-%20%2009%2014.md#product-features) are listed here. And I created a [progress video](https://youtu.be/6hY8ILsYISs) to record what I did and learned. The personal [reflection and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%203%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2007%20-%20%2009%2014.md#reflections) can be found here.
This is my current design for project 1.

# Report 2 - Week of 08/31 - 09/07

This week has been a work-life balanced week. I mainly further [baked and redefined the grasshopper model](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%202%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2031%20-%2009%2007.md#bake-and-redefine-the-model-for-3d-printing) based on my personal preferences, modified the 3D printed model and prepared it for printing. Based on those, I also did my personal [reflection](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%202%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2031%20-%2009%2007.md#reflections).

# Report 1 - Week of 08/24 - 08/31

I had a **fantastic** first week at MDes and TDF! I spent some time [exploring Rhino, Grasshopper, and GitHub](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%201%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2024%20-%2008%2031%20d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe.md#explore-the-design-tools), which are all new to me. Also, I [laser cut](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%201%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2024%20-%2008%2031%20d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe.md#laser-cutting) the cell phone holder, I would say it was a fun and frustrating process, which inspired me a lot. [Outside of work](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%201%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2024%20-%2008%2031%20d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe.md#outside-of-tdf-what-i-did-this-week), I decorated my bedroom and had some interesting [reflections](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%201%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2024%20-%2008%2031%20d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe.md#reflections). Please find my [report for week 1](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%201%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2024%20-%2008%2031%20d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe.md) here!
