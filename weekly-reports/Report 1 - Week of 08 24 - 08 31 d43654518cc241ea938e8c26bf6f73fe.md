# Report 1 - Week of 08/24 - 08/31

# Hey guys! ðŸ˜„Welcome to my weekly report!

I had a **fantastic** first week at MDes and TDF! I spent some time [exploring Rhino, Grasshopper, and GitHub](https://www.notion.so/Report-1-Week-of-08-24-08-31-d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe?pvs=21), which are all new to me. Also, I [laser cut](https://www.notion.so/Report-1-Week-of-08-24-08-31-d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe?pvs=21) the cell phone holder, I would say it was a fun and frustrating process, which inspired me a lot. [Outside of work](https://www.notion.so/Report-1-Week-of-08-24-08-31-d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe?pvs=21), I decorated my bedroom and had some interesting [reflections](https://www.notion.so/Report-1-Week-of-08-24-08-31-d43654518cc241ea938e8c26bf6f73fe?pvs=21). Please read on!

## *Explore the design tools*

During undergraduate study, I used Rhino as a CAD modeling tool before, but I never used it to create computational design. Therefore, parametric modeling with grasshopper is a novel experience for me!

To start with, I followed the instructions to download the required plugin on food4Rhino.

After some exploration, I learned to adjust the parameters in gh to modify the design.

However, because of my unfamiliarity with the interface, I still can't quickly locate the parameter I want to adjust and manipulate it, and I'm looking for a more concise approach.

In addition, I also worked with the stand for 3d printing. I ended up choosing laser cutting because I had more previous experience with 3d printing but never with laser cutting. I will be operating and consolidating 3d printing sometime next week, including understanding the advantages of each of the different machines.
