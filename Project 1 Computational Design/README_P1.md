# Report 3 - Week of 09/07 - 09/14

This week, I mainly focused on Project 1: Computational Design. I redesigned the cell phone stand based on my preferences; [product features](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%203%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2007%20-%20%2009%2014.md#product-features) are listed here. And I created a [progress video](https://youtu.be/6hY8ILsYISs) to record what I did and learned. The personal [reflection and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%203%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2007%20-%20%2009%2014.md#reflections) can be found here.
This is my current design for project 1.
