# Report 5 - Week of 09/21 - 09/28

# Hello! üêà Welcome to my weekly report!

During this week, I've been [learning and experimenting with Photon 2](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#learning-and-experimenting-with-photon-2), guided by Sudhu's helpful tutorial. We also brainstormed for our next project, coming up with many exciting ideas. Additionally, we had a special guest, [Adrian Freed](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#adrian-freeds-lecture), who shared his experiences and knowledge, especially about something called the E-textile Swatch Exchange. Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%205%20-%20Week%20of%2009%2021%20-%2009%2028.md#reflections-and-speculations) here.
 

## *Learning and experimenting with Photon 2*
We began by reviewing the basics of digital boards. As we progressed, we took things a step further by adding extra lights and components like resistors, exploring how we can make them interact using Photon 2's codes.

I tried to modify the parameters to achieve different effects.

However, in the last exercise, the LDR (light dependent resistor) did not produce the correct effect. After checking, I found that the problem was that it did not cooperate with the correct output code. By improving the input, I achieved the correct output.

## *Adrian Freed's lecture*
Adrian Freed is a respected individual in the electronics and technology domain, recognized for his significant contributions. During the engaging session, I had the opportunity to sit closer to the front, granting a clear view of the prototypes he showcased. Through insightful lectures and discussions, Adrian generously shared his vast knowledge and experiences, offering valuable insights into the creative and innovative applications within the exciting world of E-textiles.

## *Reflections and speculations*
- In the brainstorming session, I found it challenging to fully immerse myself in the topic, Energy, leading to limited contributions. I am grateful to my teammates for their support and encouragement, which played a significant role in helping me broaden my perspective and become more actively engaged during the recent brainstorming session.
- One positive outcome is recognizing my proficiency in grasping photon 2 concepts relatively quickly. This realization has motivated me to challenge myself further in the upcoming sessions by delving into more complex topics and striving for more creative and intriguing outputs.
- I found Adrian Freed's lecture to be truly inspirational. His insights and experiences, regarding the E-textile Swatch Exchange, have encouraged me to explore innovative ideas and collaborative ventures within the realm of electronics and technology. I'm excited to incorporate these learnings into our future discussions and projects.
