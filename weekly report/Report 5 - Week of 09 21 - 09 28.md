# Report 5 - Week of 09/21 - 09/28

# Hello! üêà Welcome to my weekly report!

During this week, I've been learning and experimenting with Photon 2, guided by Sudhu's helpful tutorial. We also brainstormed for our next project, coming up with many exciting ideas. Additionally, we had a special guest, Adrian Freed, who shared his experiences and knowledge, especially about something called the E-textile Swatch Exchange. Please find my reflections and speculations here.

## *Reflections and speculations*
- In the brainstorming session, I found it challenging to fully immerse myself in the topic, Energy, leading to limited contributions. I am grateful to my teammates for their support and encouragement, which played a significant role in helping me broaden my perspective and become more actively engaged during the recent brainstorming session.
- One positive outcome is recognizing my proficiency in grasping photon 2 concepts relatively quickly. This realization has motivated me to challenge myself further in the upcoming sessions by delving into more complex topics and striving for more creative and intriguing outputs.
- I found Adrian Freed's lecture to be truly inspirational. His insights and experiences, regarding the E-textile Swatch Exchange, have encouraged me to explore innovative ideas and collaborative ventures within the realm of electronics and technology. I'm excited to incorporate these learnings into our future discussions and projects.
