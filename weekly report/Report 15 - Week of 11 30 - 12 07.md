## *Reflections and speculations*
- Our team was awesome! We finished everything as scheduled and had some sleep during the final week. Our collaborative efforts and diverse perspectives were invaluable throughout this project. Special thanks to our instructors Jeff, TJ, Shm, and Sudhu, whose insightful feedback significantly shaped our project's direction. Our shop technicians, Cody and Chris, are heartfeltly grateful for their expertise and patience during the prototyping phase.
