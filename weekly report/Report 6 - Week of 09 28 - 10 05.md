# Report 6 - Week of 09/28 - 10/05

# Hello! ðŸŒž Welcome to my weekly report!

This week, my teammates and I engaged in a productive meeting on "Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education." We conducted a brainstorming session, generating various intriguing directions and ideas for our project. In addition, I spent time exploring Photon 2, seeking to understand how to integrate it into our second project. Further reflections and speculations on these experiences can be found here.

## *Brainstorm for Project 2*

On Tuesday, I met up my teammate in Project 2, we had a efficient disscussion to specificate our project direction. Based on our background and preferences, we decided to focus the topic on children with visual impairments and make heartwarming designs for them. Here is the reference I found to inspire future direction.

[LEGOÂ® Braille Bricks](https://legobraillebricks.com/)

An innovative approach to introducing visually impaired and blind children to the Braille system of reading and writing, while also providing a playful and interactive educational tool.

Key features
- Braille and Printed Characters: Each brick features a set of raised studs used to represent the Braille alphabet, numbers, and a selection of punctuation and mathematical symbols. Alongside the Braille symbols, the corresponding printed letter or character is also included on the brick to allow sighted people to understand and interact.
- Inclusivity in Learning: The initiative promotes inclusivity by enabling visually impaired children to learn Braille while playing and interacting with sighted peers and educators, facilitating a common ground through play.
- Versatility: LEGOÂ® Braille Bricks can be used in a variety of educational contexts, such as language learning, mathematics, and also for creative storytelling and interactive play.

In our project, we will intergrate hardwares to make the interaction more friendly and enjoyable for visually impaired childeren. 

## Work with Photon 2*

On Thursday's session, I followed the instrucation to install Particle Workbench and VS Code, but errors occured as the screenshot shows.

I would like to especially thank Jingyi for helping me fix the problem.

## *Reflections and Speculations*

- During last week, we but we did have some challenges in splitting group. One significant hurdle was establishing a universally satisfactory grouping standard since clear cooperation goals and preferences were not consistently defined across members. This project demanded both hardware utilization and code writing; hence, programming skills were pivotal. However, our collective confidence in our programming abilities was somewhat shaky, making group balancing a complex task. 
- Fortunately, we managed to formulate groups that appeased the majority. Concurrently, my two team members and I engaged in productive brainstorming sessions, successfully determining our project's overall direction.
- Moving forward, I am eager to explore more about hardware and investigate how it can be genuinely integrated into our project to effectively assist a specific demographic.
