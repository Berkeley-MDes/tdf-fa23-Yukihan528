# Report 13 - Week of 11/16 - 11/23

# Hello! ðŸ˜„Welcome to my weekly report!
Happy thanksgiving! And I've been working on [project 4](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2013%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2016%20-%2011%2023.md#project-4-progress) online with my partners. Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2013%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2016%20-%2011%2023.md#reflection-and-speculations) here.

## *Project 4 progress*
This week was mainly the Thanksgiving holiday, considering the arrangement of team members during the holiday, we carried out the project division in the session on Thursday. I am mainly responsible for product function iteration, charon is responsible for code, and jiayi is responsible for ai training.

## *Reflection and speculations*
- While we initially distributed our tasks, it became evident that the project cannot be neatly segmented into three distinct parts due to their interrelated nature. This interconnectedness has made iterative development more challenging, suggesting that face-to-face collaboration might be a more effective approach. A clear example of this was encountered in the details of 3D printing, where the segmented approach led to issues in the 3D printed components we worked on this week.
