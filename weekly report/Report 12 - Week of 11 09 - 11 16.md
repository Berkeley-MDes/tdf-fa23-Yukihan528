## *Guest lecture from John MacCallum*
The OSCript demonstration was not only helpful but also showed immense potential, in my opinion.

## *Project 4 Proposal Pin-up Gallery*
The posters displayed everyone's ideas for their final projects, which were very enlightening. I have decided to continue improving the design of our Project 2 with Charon and Jiayi. We will refine the design based on feedback and reflection, building upon our existing prototype, to make it adaptable to different scenarios.

## *Reflections and speculations*
- For our Project 4, integrating personalized AI could be key in enhancing the user experience through customized feedback. Yet, this heightened level of personalization raises significant privacy concerns. As we navigate the complexities of data collection and user consent, we might encounter ongoing debates and the potential for new regulatory measures concerning the extent of personal information accessed by AI systems. As designers, it's imperative for us to approach these issues with thoughtful consideration.
