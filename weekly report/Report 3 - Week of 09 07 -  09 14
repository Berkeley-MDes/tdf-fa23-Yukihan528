# Report 2 - Week of 08/31 - 09/07

# Hello! ☀️Welcome to my weekly report!

This week has been a work-life balanced week. I mainly further [baked and redefined the grasshopper model](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%202%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2031%20-%2009%2007.md#bake-and-redefine-the-model-for-3d-printing) based on my personal preferences, modified the 3D printed model and prepared it for printing. Based on those, I also did my personal [reflection](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%202%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2031%20-%2009%2007.md#reflections).

## *Bake and redefine the model for 3D printing*

Last week, I focused on the model for laser cutting and this is the final product.

This week, I spent more time exploring the model for 3D printing. I started by measuring the dimensions of my phone.

Then, I modified the parameters in Grasshopper to make the model fit my phone.

Considering my personal usage scenarios, I prefer to shoot portrait videos. Therefore, I tried to modify the stand for portrait support.

![reshape to allow portrait hold](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%202%20-%20Week%20of%2008%2031%20-%2009%2007/reshape%20to%20alow%20portrait%20hold.png)

A problem arises in that the phone cannot be charged in such a state of use, and the shooting range is poor. To solve this problem, I redesigned the back of the model to allow the charging cable to go through.

After modifying the model, I filleted the edges to make it smoother.

Finally, I exported the model to an STL file for 3D printing.

For next week, I will print it out with Makerbot 3 or other printers at Jacobs Hall.

## *Reflections*

- This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of various **software tools** such as Grasshopper, and Rhino, as well as honing my **fabrication skills**. The newly designed phone stand offers enhanced stability and versatility, featuring more personalized functions, and its angle is perfectly tailored to match both my height and the table's height, facilitating the filming of myself while engaged in various activities.

- To enhance future iterations, I plan to **consider different user needs** rather than solely relying on my own preferences. I believe that by adopting this approach, the product can become even more innovative and versatile.
