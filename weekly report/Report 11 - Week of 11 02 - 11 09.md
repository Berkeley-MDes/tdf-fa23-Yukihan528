# Report 11 - Week of 11/02 - 11/09

# Hello! ðŸ¤” Welcome to my weekly report!
This week marked a recovery period, after receiving feedback from my peers on Project 3, I've successfully completed the documentation for it. Also, we kicked off Project 4 and had a cool guest lecture from Mohit Bhoite.
