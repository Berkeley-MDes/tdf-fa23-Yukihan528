# Report 11 - Week of 11/02 - 11/09

# Hello! ðŸ¤” Welcome to my weekly report!
This week marked a recovery period. After receiving feedback from my peers on [Project 3](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2011%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2002%20-%2011%2009.md#project-3-final), I successfully completed its documentation. Also, we [kicked off Project 4](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2011%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2002%20-%2011%2009.md#project-4-kick-off) and had a cool [guest lecture from Mohit Bhoite](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2011%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2002%20-%2011%2009.md#guest-lecture-from-mohit-bhoite). Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%208%20-%20Week%20of%2010%2012%20-%2010%2019.md#reflections-and-speculations) here.

## *Project 3 final*
During Thursday's class, we had a critique session, providing a cool and inspirational opportunity to see everyone's mini-me projects.

The feedback on my project was largely positive, highlighting the successful aspects while also pointing out areas for improvement.
- It was suggested that the user experience could benefit from additional training and clearer instructions to enhance interaction with the interface.
- As the first presenter in Shm's group, we encountered a technical issue with the stereo and overlooked enabling automatic subtitles, which affected the audio clarity. - There were noted errors concerning the token limit, indicating a need for better explanation and management of this technical aspect.

*How to Improve?*
- Use end-of-video visuals effectively and include annotations during the video to guide viewers through the process.
- Add closed captions.
- Explore more about the max tokens.

## *Project 4 kick-off*
In Project 4: Mix, Master, Extend, and Evolve, my current plan revolves around enhancing Project 2: Build a Digital Ecosystem. This earlier project involved the design of an interactive Braille Study Module for Visually Impaired Children. Building upon the feedback received, my approach will include a reevaluation of product materials and a deeper involvement in user research. I am eager to observe how these adjustments will contribute to the overall improvement of the project.

## *Guest Lecture from Mohit Bhoite*

The guest lecture was incredibly interesting, offering enlightening insights into the multitude of objects created using particle devices.

## *Reflections and Spaculations*
- Receiving feedback is consistently beneficial, and it's often surprising to discover areas for improvement from another person's perspective.
- This week has marked significant advancements in the AI industry, capturing my attention as a product designer deeply interested in UX. Anticipating the GPT-4.0 launch event, I foresee promising opportunities for both fields. The integration of advanced natural language understanding has the potential to enhance the intuitiveness and context-awareness of design tools. Additionally, I envision GPT-4.0 improving prototyping capabilities, potentially streamlining the iterative design process. The combination of these advancements could significantly impact the way product designers approach their work and collaborate in user experience design.
