# Report 7 - Week of 10/05 - 10/12

# Hello! ðŸ’» Welcome to my weekly report!

This week, my teammates and I worked on Project 2: Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education. We defined our design content and did some practical testing with Photon 2. Please find my reflections and speculations here.

## *Working on Project 2*

Based on our project specification, we further brainstormed the specific scenarios and potential functions of our prototypes. Here are some records.

Also, TJ helped us figure out some possible ways to make the communication of photons, which was inspirational.

Then, we did the practical test on RFID, the suitable component for our project. With the help from Shm and an online tutorial, we can connect 2 RFIDs to 1 Photon now.

At this stage, we are still struggling with communicating between Photons; we should try to figure it out together.

## *Reflections and Speculations*

- First of all, I would say our group is nice. We all worked and helped each other, especially when things got tough. Though it was our first time using Photon, we overcame many challenges together, which was warm and encourageable.
- As for Photon, I still have reservations. Compared with Arduino, its compatibility is not strong, resulting in low efficiency for us to complete some tasks, and there are fewer resources available online.
- Also, the guest lecture was inspirational.
