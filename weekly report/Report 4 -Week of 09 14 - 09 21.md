# Report 4 - Week of 09/14 - 09/21

# Hello! ðŸ‘€ Welcome to my weekly report!

This week, I gathered [feedback from my peers and documented Project 1: Computational Design](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%204%20-Week%20of%2009%2014%20-%2009%2021.md#feedback-from-peers-and-documentation). Then, we kickstarted Project 2 - The Digital Ecosystem! I followed Sudhu's Photon2 tutorial to [set up my device](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%204%20-Week%20of%2009%2014%20-%2009%2021.md#set-up-photon-2).

## *Feedback from peers and documentation*
This table summarizes the feedback I received during the critic session. I tried to improve the design combining different perspectives.

## *Reflections and speculations*
- In terms of project 1 documentation, the weekly reports were super helpful. They let me easily look back and see how things progressed while summarizing the important stuff. Also, peers' feedback was a big help. It gave me different ideas to improve the design. It's good to listen to different thoughts when working on a designâ€”it makes it better! The suggestions and input from my teammates helped make the project better each step of the way.
- I am deeply passionate about Project 2 and eager to delve into the digital ecosystem. Exploring this area further will significantly augment my comprehension and capacity to devise effective strategies in the digital realm. I am hopeful that this study will enrich my knowledge and facilitate collaborative learning with my classmates.
