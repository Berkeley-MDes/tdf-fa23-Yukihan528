# Report 3 - Week of 09/07 - 09/14

# Hello! ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my weekly report!

This week I focused on Project 1: Computational Design, I redesigned the cell phone stand based on my preferences. And I created a [progress video](https://youtu.be/6hY8ILsYISs) to record what I did and learned. The personal reflection and speculations can be found here.

Finally, I exported the model to an STL file for 3D printing.

For next week, I will print it out with Makerbot 3 or other printers at Jacobs Hall.

## *Reflections*

- This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of various **software tools** such as Grasshopper, and Rhino, as well as honing my **fabrication skills**. The newly designed phone stand offers enhanced stability and versatility, featuring more personalized functions, and its angle is perfectly tailored to match both my height and the table's height, facilitating the filming of myself while engaged in various activities.

- To enhance future iterations, I plan to **consider different user needs** rather than solely relying on my own preferences. I believe that by adopting this approach, the product can become even more innovative and versatile.
