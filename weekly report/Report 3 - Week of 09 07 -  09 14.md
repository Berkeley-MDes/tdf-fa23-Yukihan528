# Report 3 - Week of 09/07 - 09/14

# Hello! ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my weekly report!

This week, I mainly focused on Project 1: Computational Design. I redesigned the cell phone stand based on my preferences. And I created a [progress video](https://youtu.be/6hY8ILsYISs) to record what I did and learned. The personal reflection and speculations can be found here.


## *Redesign the cell phone stand*

At the beginning of the week, I decided to redesign the model instead of continuing to work on last week's model, as I redefined my challenges and design goals, while the original model was too limiting to work on.

As I reflected on my daily life, I noticed two common scenarios where I use a cell phone stand: FaceTiming with my family and friends and watching videos while eating.

## *Reflections*

- This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of various **software tools** such as Grasshopper, and Rhino, as well as honing my **fabrication skills**. The newly designed phone stand offers enhanced stability and versatility, featuring more personalized functions, and its angle is perfectly tailored to match both my height and the table's height, facilitating the filming of myself while engaged in various activities.

- To enhance future iterations, I plan to **consider different user needs** rather than solely relying on my own preferences. I believe that by adopting this approach, the product can become even more innovative and versatile.
