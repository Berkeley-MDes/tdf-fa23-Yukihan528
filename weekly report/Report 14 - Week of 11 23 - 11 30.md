# Report 14 - Week of 11/23 - 11/30

# Hello! ðŸ˜„Welcome to my weekly report!
This week, we have been diligently working on [Project 4](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2014%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2023%20-%2011%2030.md#project-4-progress). Please find my [reflections and speculations](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-Yukihan528/blob/main/weekly%20report/Report%2014%20-%20Week%20of%2011%2023%20-%2011%2030.md#reflections-and-speculations) here.

## *Project 4 progress*
We revised the user flow based on user and peer feedback.

## *Reflections and speculations*
- The main factor hindering the advancement of our project this week is equipment limitation, because cohort 3 and 4 are all doing the final project, and a lot of students in mechanical engineering are also using 3d printers. It will take us a long time to queue up for printing, which seriously slows down the progress of the project, which I know is inevitable. Starting early may be the only solution
